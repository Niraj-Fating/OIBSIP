            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Niraj Fating, a passionate software developer with a deep interest in creating impactful digital solutions. My journey in technology began with a curiosity for how things work, which soon evolved into a love for coding and problem-solving. With a strong foundation in computer science, I have honed my skills in full-stack development, working with a range of technologies that power the web and beyond.

                My expertise lies in building efficient, scalable web applications. From front-end design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React, to back-end development with Node.js and databases like MongoDB and MySQL, I thrive on delivering clean, functional code. I am particularly interested in modern web development practices, including API design, cloud services, and responsive UI/UX design that enhances user experience.
                
                I am continuously learning and adapting to new technologies and trends in the tech space. My approach to software development is collaborative and user-focused, ensuring that every solution I develop solves real-world problems effectively and elegantly. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I bring a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and a drive for excellence.
                
                In my spare time, I love to explore emerging tech, contribute to open-source projects, and expand my knowledge through various online courses and hackathons. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow both personally and professionally.</p>
